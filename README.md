README: NLP Tasks and Solutions
This document explains the tasks completed in this repository. Each task demonstrates different aspects of NLP using popular libraries like SpaCy and HuggingFace Transformers.

1. NLP Preprocessing Pipeline
Goal: Implement a pipeline to preprocess text data.

Steps:

Tokenize the sentence into individual words.

Remove common English stopwords (e.g., "the", "in", "are").

Apply stemming to reduce words to their root form.

Example:
Input: "NLP techniques are used in virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri."
Output:

Tokens: List of all words.

Tokens without stopwords: Only meaningful words.

Stemmed words: Reduced to root form.

2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) with SpaCy
Goal: Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy.

Steps:

Load a pre-trained SpaCy model.

Extract entities such as PERSON, LOCATION, DATE, etc.

Print the entity text, label, and position in the sentence.

Example:
Input: "Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009."
Output:

Text: "Barack Obama", Label: "PERSON", Start: 0, End: 12

Text: "2009", Label: "DATE", Start: 93, End: 97

3. Scaled Dot-Product Attention
Goal: Implement Scaled Dot-Product Attention.

Steps:

Calculate the dot product of Query (Q) and Key (Kᵀ) matrices.

Scale by √d (key dimension).

Apply softmax to get attention weights.

Multiply weights by Value (V) to get the final output.

Example:

Input matrices:
Q = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]
K = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]
V = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]

Output:

Attention Weights: After softmax.

Final Output: Result of multiplying attention weights by V.

4. Sentiment Analysis using HuggingFace Transformers
Goal: Perform sentiment analysis using the HuggingFace Transformers library.

Steps:

Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.

Analyze a given sentence for sentiment (positive/negative).

Print the sentiment label and confidence score.

Example:
Input: "Despite the high price, the performance of the new MacBook is outstanding."
Output:

Sentiment: "POSITIVE"

Confidence Score: 0.9992

How to Run the Code

Conclusion
These tasks showcase how NLP tasks can be solved using pre-trained models.

Pre-trained models save time, improve performance, and require less data for fine-tuning.

The tasks cover basic text processing, entity recognition, attention mechanisms, and sentiment analysis.
